Idempotentally (yes I know its not spelled this way)
============

Oh no, did I break the site  
Oh I ran that script twice  
I altered things unforeseen  

Did I accidentally change  
the state of things again  
beyond a state of safety  

Idempotently, Idempotentally  
I will code you idempotentally  
There is no fear that  
runs will end differently  
I will code you idempotentally.  

Run just as you are again  
with the exact same in  
puts changes nothing for me  

Unintended consequences  
things that don't make sense  
are now ancient history (history)  

Idempotently, Idempotentally  
I will code you idempotentally  
There is no fear that  
runs will end differently  
I will code you idempotentally.  

Open up your shell and just let that script run,
Call that API again just just for fun  
Open up your shell and just let that script run,  
Open up your shell and just let that script run,  
Open up your shell  

Repeatability is the key to being free  
and changing data safely (safely)   

Idempotently, Idempotentally  
I will code you idempotentally  
There is no fear that  
runs will end differently  
'Cause I will code you idempotentally (oh yeah)  
I will code you (idempotentally)  
I will code you  
I will code you idempotentally
