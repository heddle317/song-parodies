Look at this stuff
Isnt it neat?
Wouldnt you think my collections complete?
Wouldnt you think I'm the girl the girl who has everything.

Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one server hold?
Looking around here you think
Sure, she's got everything

I've got frameworks and source code a-plenty
I've got data and servers galore
You want standard libraries?
I've got twenty!
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the neckbeards are
I wanna see, wanna see them hacking,
Typing around on those - what do you call 'em?
Oh - feet!

Smooth unshaved skin you don't get too far
Beards are required for kernal patching
Strolling along down a - what's that word again?
Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
Part of that world


What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand


I'm ready to know what the neckbeards know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?
Burn?
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
