Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collections complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl the girl who has everything.

Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one server hold?
Looking around here you think
Sure, she's got everything

I've got frameworks and source code a-plenty
I've got data and networks galore
You want standard libraries?
I've got twenty!
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the neckbeards are
I wanna see, wanna see them hacking,
Getting a tan off of - what do you call 'em?
Oh - screens!

Smooth unshaved skin you don't get too far
Beards are required for kernel patching
Memorizing some - what's that word again?
RFCs

Down where they code, portscanning nodes,
Down where they add new dtrace probes,
Copywrite free - wish I could be
Part of that world


What would I give if I could write my own kernel?
What would I pay to spend a day installing GNU?
Bet'cha in chat they all know that
They cannot even tell I'm human
Bright young women, learn to admin 
sudo su


I'm ready to know what the neckbeards know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a select call and why does it - what's the word?
Block?
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that boot loader GRUB?
No more PCs
Wish I could be
Part of that world
