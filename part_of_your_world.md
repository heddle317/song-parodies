# Part of your World (Neckbeard Parody) #
=========================================

Look at this stuff  
Isn't it neat?  
Wouldn't you think my collections complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl the girl who has everything.  


Look at this trove  
Treasures untold  
How many wonders can one server hold?  
Looking around here you think  
Sure, she's got everything  


I've got frameworks and source code a-plenty  
I've got data and networks galore  
You want standard libraries?  
I've got twenty!  
But who cares?  
No big deal  
I want more  


I wanna be where the neckbeards are  
I wanna see, wanna see them hacking,  
Getting a tan off those - what do you call 'em?  
Oh - screens!  


Smooth unshaved skin you don't get too far  
Beards are required for kernel patching  
Semaphore waiting in - what's that language again?  
C  


Down where they code, portscanning nodes,  
Down where they're adding new dtrace probes,  
Copywrite free - wish I could be  
Part of that world  


What would I give if I could build program interfaces?  
What would I pay to spend a day installing GNU?  
Betcha with beards code's crystal clear,  
bet they don't even check stack traces  
Bright young women, not just admins  
sudo su  


I'm ready to know what the neckbeards know  
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers  
What's a select call and why does it - what's the word?  
Block?  
When's it my turn?  
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that boot loader GRUB?  
No more PCs  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world  
Neckbeard and free  
Wish I could be  
Part of your world
