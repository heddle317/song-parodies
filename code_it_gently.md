# Code It Gently #

This is a song for the coders  
But all you non-programmers out there, listen closely


You don't always have to code so hard  
In fact sometimes that's not right to do  
Sometimes you've got to take your time  
And fucking user test your shit too.  


Sometimes ya got to peer review  
Sometimes ya got to pair too  
Sometime you've got to say hey  


I'm gonna code you softly  
I'm gonna test you gently  
I'm gonna merge you sweetly  
Then I'll deploy you completely  


And then you say hey I'll help a teammate  
And then you say hey don't fuck that up, wait  
I think you've got a bug in your commit  
Could you get it out for me  
That's fucking teamwork  


What's your IDE  
That's cool with me  
Vim's not my favorite but I'll use it for you  
Production's down for me  
I'm not gonna fix it but I'll log a bug in Asana  


And then I'm gonna code you completely  
And then I'll fucking test you discreetly  
And then I'll fucking merge you completely  
But then I'm gonna code you hard  
Hard
