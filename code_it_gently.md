# Code It Gently #
==================

This is a song for the coders  
But all you non-programmers out there, listen closely


You don't always have to code so hard  
In fact sometimes that's not right to do  
Somtimes you've got to take your time  
And fucking user test your shit too.  


*Sometimes ya got to squeeze  
Sometimes you've got to say please  
Sometime you've got to say hey*  


I'm gonna code you softly  
I'm gonna test you gently  
I'm gonna merge you sweetly  
Then I'll deploy you completely  


*And then you say hey I bought you flowers  
And then you say wait a minute sally*  
I think I've got a bug in my commit  
Could you get it out for me  
That's fucking teamwork  


*What's your fave posish?  
That's cool with me  
It's not my favorite  
But I'll do it for you  
What's your favorite dish?  
I'm not gonna cook it  
But I'll order it from Zanzibar*  


And then I'm gonna code you completely  
And then I'll fucking test you discreetly  
And then I'll fucking merge you completely  
But then I'm gonna code you hard  
Hard
